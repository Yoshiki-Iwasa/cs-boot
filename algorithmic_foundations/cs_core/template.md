# Title

# Illustrative Learning Outcomes


## For each ADT/Data-Structure in this unit, explain its definition, properties, representation(s), and associated ADT operations.


## For each ADT/Data-Structure in this unit, explain step-by-step how the ADT operations associated with the data structure transform it.


## For each algorithm in this unit explain step-by-step how the algorithm operates.

## For each algorithmic approach (e.g., sorting) in this unit apply a prototypical example of the approach (e.g., merge sort).

## Given requirements for a problem, develop multiple solutions using various data structures and algorithms. Subsequently, evaluate the suitability, strengths, and weaknesses selecting an approach that best satisfies the requirements.

## Explain how collision avoidance and collision resolution is handled in hash tables.

## Explain factors beyond computational efficiency that influence the choice of algorithms, such as programming time, maintainability, and the use of application-specific patterns in the input data.

## Explain the heap property and the use of heaps as an implementation of a priority queue.
