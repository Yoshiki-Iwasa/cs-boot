# Title

# Illustrative Learning Outcomes

## Use recurrence relations to evaluate the time complexity of recursively defined algorithms.

## Apply elementary recurrence relations using a form of the Master Theorem.

## Apply Big-O notation to give upper case bounds on time/space complexity of algorithms.

## Explain the Cook-Levin Theorem and the NP-Completeness of SAT.


## Explain the classes P and NP.

## Prove that a problem is NP-Complete by reducing a classic known NP-C problem to it (e.g., 3SAT and Clique).

## Explain the P-space class and its relation to the EXP class.
