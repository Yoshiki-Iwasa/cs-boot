# Title

# Illustrative Learning Outcomes
## For each of the paradigms in this unit,
### Explain its definitional characteristics,
### Explain an example that demonstrates the paradigm including how this example satisfies the paradigmâ€™s characteristics.


## For each of the algorithms in the AL-Foundational unit, explain the paradigm used by the algorithm and how it exemplifies this paradigm.


## Given an algorithm, explain the paradigm used by the algorithm and how it exemplifies this paradigm.


## Give a real-world problem, evaluate appropriate algorithmic paradigms and algorithms from these paradigms that address the problem including evaluating the tradeoffs among the paradigms and algorithms selected.


## Give examples of iterative and recursive algorithms that solve the same problem, explain the benefits and disadvantages of each approach.


## Evaluate whether a greedy approach leads to an optimal solution.

## Explain various approaches for addressing computational problems whose algorithmic solutions are exponential.
